the idea is a website for creating and reading curriculums, which are roadmaps to learn different subjects, with every step in a path containing resources such as names of books, youtube channels and online resources.

users can create roadmaps and edit them. each time a roadmap is released, it is released under a new version, so that users who were following the roadmap before its update, dont lose access to the old version.

a roadmap has a like counter, and an author label, so that people can judge each roadmap, and validate who posted it.

users can search roadmaps based on the roadmap title, label or author.,

a roadmap is a list of "areas", and each "area" has an article, which contains a title, a description and a list of resource items.

a resource item can be a text or a link (render open graph).

each "area" can be linked to another, even to multiple "areas"
